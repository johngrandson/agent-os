# Event Bus Redesign Implementation Plan

## Overview
Migrate from "webhook" to "messages" domain using business language instead of technical terms. This creates a parallel system that will eventually replace the webhook domain.

## Stage 1: Structure Base
**Goal**: Create basic directory structure and core classes for messages domain
**Success Criteria**:
- Directory `app/events/domains/messages/` exists with proper structure
- Base event classes created following existing patterns
- All imports work correctly
**Tests**: Import tests pass, structure follows project conventions
**Status**: Complete

## Stage 2: First Event Implementation
**Goal**: Implement MessageReceived event with basic functionality
**Success Criteria**:
- MessageReceived event class created
- Basic publisher for messages domain
- Tests for MessageReceived event
- Event can be published and follows domain patterns
**Tests**:
- Test MessageReceived event creation
- Test event publishing through message publisher
- Test domain prefix is correct ("messages")
**Status**: Complete

## Stage 3: Message Handler System
**Goal**: Create message event handlers and routing
**Success Criteria**:
- Message event handlers implemented
- Router integration with event registry
- Handler tests pass
- Integration with existing broker system
**Tests**:
- Test handlers receive and process events
- Test router registration
- Test integration with existing event system
**Status**: Not Started

## Stage 4: MessageSent Event
**Goal**: Add MessageSent event to complete basic message lifecycle
**Success Criteria**:
- MessageSent event implemented
- Publisher supports both MessageReceived and MessageSent
- Complete test coverage for both events
**Tests**:
- Test MessageSent event creation and publishing
- Test complete message lifecycle (received -> sent)
- Test publisher handles multiple event types
**Status**: Not Started

## Stage 5: Integration Testing
**Goal**: Ensure new messages domain integrates properly with existing system
**Success Criteria**:
- Integration tests pass
- New system coexists with webhook domain
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Performance is acceptable
**Tests**:
- End-to-end integration tests
- Performance benchmarks
- Regression tests for webhook domain
**Status**: Not Started

## Notes
- Keep webhook domain untouched during implementation
- Follow TDD approach for each stage
- Use incremental commits for each working piece
- Follow project conventions from existing event domains
- Use business language ("messages") instead of technical terms ("webhook")
