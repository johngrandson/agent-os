# FastStream Horizontal Scaling Implementation Plan

## Overview
Transform current single-process FastStream implementation into horizontally scalable architecture using FastStream CLI multiprocessing capabilities and container orchestration.

## Stage 1: FastStream Multi-Worker Foundation

**Goal**: Enable FastStream multi-worker processing within containers
**Success Criteria**:
- FastStream app can run with multiple workers locally
- Event processing scales across workers
- No shared state conflicts
**Tests**:
- Load test with multiple concurrent events
- Verify worker process distribution
- Test event delivery guarantees
**Status**: Not Started

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create FastStream CLI entry point module
- [ ] Extract shared state from in-memory to Redis
- [ ] Update Docker containers to use FastStream CLI
- [ ] Add worker process monitoring and health checks

## Stage 2: Container Orchestration Scaling

**Goal**: Deploy multiple container instances with load balancing
**Success Criteria**:
- Multiple API containers can run simultaneously
- Load balancer distributes HTTP traffic
- Event processing remains consistent across instances
**Tests**:
- Deploy 3 container instances
- Verify load distribution
- Test event processing under load
**Status**: Not Started

### Tasks:
- [ ] Add nginx load balancer to docker-compose
- [ ] Create production docker-compose with scaling
- [ ] Implement health check endpoints
- [ ] Add container restart policies

## Stage 3: State Management Optimization

**Goal**: Eliminate all shared state bottlenecks
**Success Criteria**:
- Agent cache is fully distributed via Redis
- Session state is externalized
- Database connections are pooled properly
**Tests**:
- Test agent state consistency across instances
- Verify cache hit rates and performance
- Load test database connection handling
**Status**: Not Started

### Tasks:
- [ ] Migrate agent cache to Redis-backed distributed cache
- [ ] Implement session state externalization
- [ ] Add database connection pooling optimization
- [ ] Add monitoring for cache performance

## Stage 4: Production Deployment Pipeline

**Goal**: Automated deployment with zero-downtime scaling
**Success Criteria**:
- Blue-green deployment capability
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (if using Kubernetes)
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
**Tests**:
- Deploy new version without downtime
- Test auto-scaling under load
- Verify monitoring alerts work correctly
**Status**: Not Started

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create Kubernetes manifests (optional)
- [ ] Add deployment scripts with health checks
- [ ] Implement monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
- [ ] Create scaling policies and thresholds

## Stage 5: Observability and Optimization

**Goal**: Production-ready monitoring and performance optimization
**Success Criteria**:
- Full distributed tracing for events
- Performance metrics and alerting
- Automated scaling based on metrics
**Tests**:
- End-to-end event tracing works
- Performance regression tests pass
- Scaling triggers work correctly
**Status**: Not Started

### Tasks:
- [ ] Add distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- [ ] Implement custom FastStream metrics
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks
- [ ] Add automated scaling triggers

## Implementation Principles

### Following CLAUDE.md Guidelines:
- **Incremental Progress**: Each stage builds on previous, no big-bang changes
- **Test-Driven**: Write tests first, ensure they pass before next stage
- **Boring Solutions**: Use proven patterns (FastStream CLI, Redis, nginx)
- **Clear Intent**: Each change has obvious purpose and clear boundaries

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Rollback Strategy**: Each stage maintains backward compatibility
- **Feature Flags**: New scaling features can be disabled
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability before production
- **Load Testing**: Validate each stage under realistic load

## Technical Decisions

### Why FastStream CLI Multi-Worker:
- **Native Support**: Built-in process management
- **Simple**: One flag (`--workers`) vs complex orchestration
- **Proven**: Production-ready scaling pattern
- **Consistent**: Maintains existing event architecture

### Why Redis for State:
- **Already Used**: Current broker, minimal new dependencies
- **Proven**: Battle-tested for distributed caching
- **Simple**: Clear semantics for cache invalidation
- **Fast**: In-memory performance characteristics

### Why Container-First Scaling:
- **Isolation**: Each container is independent unit
- **Orchestration**: Easy integration with Docker Swarm/K8s
- **Monitoring**: Clear boundaries for metrics collection
- **Deployment**: Rolling updates and blue-green deployments
