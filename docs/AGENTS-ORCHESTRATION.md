# Agent Orchestration Strategy

> **TL;DR**: This document outlines our approach to building multi-agent systems at scale, based on proven enterprise patterns. Use single agents for straightforward tasks, multi-agent systems only when you need parallel specialization. The hard part isn't the agents - it's the orchestration.

## When to Use Single vs Multi-Agent Systems

### Single Agent Works Best For:
- ✅ **Straightforward retrieval and synthesis**
  - Company policy questions
  - Research paper summarization
  - Specific data point extraction
  - Document Q&A with clear scope

### Multi-Agent Required When:
- 🔀 **Specialized reasoning across distinct domains**
  - Legal + Financial + Technical analysis
  - Different analytical frameworks needed
- 🚀 **Parallel processing of independent subtasks**
  - Risk assessment across multiple dimensions
  - Document analysis with different perspectives
- 🔗 **Multi-step workflows with complex dependencies**
  - Acquisition analysis: Financial → Legal → Market → Technical
  - Research pipeline: Data gathering → Analysis → Validation → Synthesis
- 📊 **Different analytical approaches for different data types**
  - Structured data (financial metrics) vs Unstructured (contracts)

### ⚠️ Warning Signs You Don't Need Multi-Agent:
- Single domain with clear inputs/outputs
- Sequential processing without parallelism benefits
- Simple question-answer workflows
- Context mixing issues can be solved with better prompting

## Orchestration Patterns

### 1. Hierarchical Supervision
**Best for**: Complex analytical tasks requiring coordination

```
Orchestrator Agent (Project Manager)
├── Specialist Agent A (Domain Expert)
├── Specialist Agent B (Domain Expert)
├── Specialist Agent C (Domain Expert)
└── Synthesis Agent (Results Consolidation)
```

**Implementation**:
- Orchestrator maintains global context
- Specialists focus on their domains
- Clear delegation and result aggregation
- Global state management by orchestrator

**Example Use Cases**:
- Contract analysis (clause extraction, risk assessment, precedent matching)
- Acquisition due diligence (financial, legal, technical, market)
- Regulatory compliance (multiple framework validation)

### 2. Parallel Execution with Synchronization
**Best for**: Time-sensitive analysis across domains

```
Agent A ──┐
Agent B ──┼── Sync Point ──┐
Agent C ──┘                └── Final Results
```

**Implementation**:
- Agents work simultaneously on different aspects
- Periodic synchronization intervals
- Shared state store for findings
- Conflict resolution mechanisms

**Example Use Cases**:
- Banking risk assessment (market, credit, operational risk)
- Multi-source data validation
- Real-time monitoring across different metrics

### 3. Progressive Refinement
**Best for**: Cost-efficient deep analysis

```
Broad Analysis → Focused Analysis → Detailed Analysis
      ↓               ↓                    ↓
   All Areas    →  Relevant Areas  →  Specific Issues
```

**Implementation**:
- Start with broad search/analysis
- Narrow scope based on initial findings
- Progressive deepening prevents resource waste
- Early termination for low-value paths

**Example Use Cases**:
- Research literature review
- Regulatory requirement identification
- Large document corpus analysis

## Coordination Challenges

### 1. Task Dependency Management

**Problem**: Agents need work that depends on other agents' outputs without destroying parallelism.

**Solution**: Dependency graphs with maximum parallelism
```python
# Example dependency structure
dependencies = {
    "financial_analysis": [],  # No dependencies
    "legal_review": ["financial_analysis"],  # Needs financial context
    "market_analysis": [],  # Independent
    "synthesis": ["legal_review", "market_analysis"]  # Needs all inputs
}
```

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Build dependency graphs for complex workflows
- Enable agent startup once dependencies complete
- Monitor execution order and parallel opportunities
- Fail fast on circular dependencies

### 2. State Consistency

**Problem**: Race conditions, stale reads, conflicting updates in distributed agent systems.

**Solution**: Event Sourcing with Ordered Processing
```python
# Instead of direct state updates
agent.update_state(key, value)  # ❌ Can cause conflicts

# Use event publishing
agent.publish_event("finding_discovered", {
    "agent_id": "legal_agent",
    "finding": "compliance_issue",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "timestamp": now()
})  # ✅ Ordered processing prevents conflicts
```

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Agents publish events, don't directly update state
- Single event processor maintains consistency
- Event ordering ensures reproducible results
- Enable event replay for debugging

### 3. Resource Allocation and Budgeting

**Problem**: Runaway costs from unlimited API calls and infinite task spawning.

**Solution**: Multi-level Resource Budgets
```python
agent_budget = {
    "max_documents": 100,
    "token_limit": 50000,
    "time_bound_minutes": 30,
    "api_calls": 200
}
```

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Every agent gets explicit resource budgets
- Orchestrator monitors and reallocates resources
- Circuit breakers prevent resource exhaustion
- Cost tracking at agent and workflow level

## Implementation Guidelines

### Agent Communication Protocol

```python
class AgentMessage:
    agent_id: str
    task_id: str
    message_type: MessageType  # TASK, RESULT, ERROR, STATUS
    payload: Dict[str, Any]
    confidence: float  # For result weighting
    timestamp: datetime
    parent_task_id: Optional[str]  # For dependency tracking
```

### Confidence-Weighted Synthesis

Instead of simple result merging:
```python
# ❌ Simple averaging
final_score = (agent_a_score + agent_b_score) / 2

# ✅ Confidence and authority weighting
final_score = (
    agent_a_score * agent_a_confidence * agent_a_authority +
    agent_b_score * agent_b_confidence * agent_b_authority
) / (agent_a_confidence * agent_a_authority + agent_b_confidence * agent_b_authority)
```

Authority hierarchy example:
```python
AUTHORITY_WEIGHTS = {
    "regulatory_agent": 1.0,  # Highest authority for compliance
    "sop_agent": 0.8,        # Company policies override general rules
    "general_agent": 0.6     # Lowest authority
}
```

### Agent Lifecycle Management

```python
class AgentLifecycle:
    def start_agent(self, agent_config):
        # Initialize with budget and dependencies
        pass

    def monitor_agent(self, agent_id):
        # Check resource usage and health
        pass

    def terminate_agent(self, agent_id, reason):
        # Graceful shutdown with state saving
        pass

    def restart_agent(self, agent_id, checkpoint):
        # Resume from last known good state
        pass
```

## Failure Modes and Recovery

### 1. Checkpointing Strategy

**What to Checkpoint**:
- ✅ Agent decisions and reasoning
- ✅ Task completion status
- ✅ Key findings and summaries
- ❌ Raw data (too expensive)
- ❌ Intermediate API responses

**Implementation**:
```python
checkpoint = {
    "task_id": task_id,
    "agent_decisions": agent_state.decisions,
    "completed_subtasks": [task.id for task in completed],
    "key_findings": synthesized_results,
    "next_steps": pending_tasks
}
```

### 2. Graceful Degradation

When agents fail, return partial results with transparency:
```python
{
    "status": "partial_success",
    "completed_agents": ["financial_agent", "market_agent"],
    "failed_agents": [
        {
            "agent": "legal_agent",
            "error": "timeout_after_3_attempts",
            "impact": "Cannot confirm legal compliance"
        }
    ],
    "results": {...},  # Available results
    "confidence": 0.6,  # Reduced due to missing analysis
    "recommendations": [
        "Retry legal analysis with extended timeout",
        "Manual legal review recommended"
    ]
}
```

### 3. Circuit Breakers and Backpressure

```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=3, reset_timeout=300):
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.reset_timeout = reset_timeout
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.state = "CLOSED"  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN

    def call_agent(self, agent_function, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.state == "OPEN":
            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > self.reset_timeout:
                self.state = "HALF_OPEN"
            else:
                raise CircuitBreakerOpenError()

        try:
            result = agent_function(*args, **kwargs)
            if self.state == "HALF_OPEN":
                self.state = "CLOSED"
                self.failure_count = 0
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self.failure_count += 1
            self.last_failure_time = time.time()
            if self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:
                self.state = "OPEN"
            raise
```

## Cost Management

### 1. Token Budget Allocation

```python
WORKFLOW_BUDGETS = {
    "document_analysis": {
        "total_tokens": 100000,
        "agent_allocation": {
            "orchestrator": 0.1,    # 10% for coordination
            "extraction": 0.3,      # 30% for data extraction
            "analysis": 0.4,        # 40% for deep analysis
            "synthesis": 0.2        # 20% for final synthesis
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Progressive Cost Optimization

```python
def optimize_agent_usage(task_complexity):
    if task_complexity < 0.3:
        return "single_agent"
    elif task_complexity < 0.7:
        return "hierarchical_2_level"
    else:
        return "full_multi_agent"
```

### 3. Cost Monitoring and Alerts

```python
class CostMonitor:
    def track_agent_usage(self, agent_id, tokens_used, api_calls):
        # Track per-agent costs
        pass

    def check_budget_alerts(self, workflow_id):
        usage = self.get_current_usage(workflow_id)
        budget = self.get_workflow_budget(workflow_id)

        if usage.tokens / budget.tokens > 0.8:
            self.alert_token_budget_warning(workflow_id)

        if usage.cost > budget.max_cost:
            self.halt_workflow(workflow_id, "budget_exceeded")
```

## Architecture Decisions

### Current Agent-OS Implementation

Our existing agent system already implements some of these patterns:

```
app/agents/
├── agent.py              # Base agent implementation
├── services/
│   └── agent_service.py  # Agent lifecycle management
├── repositories/
│   └── agent_repository.py
└── api/
    ├── routers.py        # Agent API endpoints
    └── schemas.py        # Agent data models
```

### Recommended Extensions

1. **Add Orchestrator Component**:
```
app/orchestration/
├── orchestrator.py       # Main orchestration logic
├── task_graph.py        # Dependency management
├── resource_manager.py  # Budget and resource allocation
└── event_processor.py   # State consistency
```

2. **Agent Communication Layer**:
```
app/agents/communication/
├── message_bus.py       # Event-driven communication
├── state_manager.py     # Shared state management
└── coordination.py      # Agent coordination protocols
```

3. **Monitoring and Recovery**:
```
app/monitoring/
├── health_monitor.py    # Agent health checks
├── cost_tracker.py      # Resource usage tracking
├── circuit_breaker.py   # Failure prevention
└── checkpoint_manager.py # State persistence
```

### Integration with Existing Event System

Our current event system (`app/events/`) can be extended:
```python
# Extend existing event patterns
class AgentCoordinationEvent(BaseEvent):
    agent_id: str
    task_id: str
    event_type: str  # TASK_STARTED, TASK_COMPLETED, AGENT_FAILED
    payload: Dict[str, Any]

# Use existing event publishers
class AgentOrchestrationEventPublisher(BaseEventPublisher):
    def get_domain_prefix(self) -> str:
        return "agent_orchestration"
```

## Decision Framework: Single vs Multi-Agent

Use this checklist to decide on architecture:

### Single Agent Sufficient When:
- [ ] Task has clear input/output boundaries
- [ ] Single domain expertise required
- [ ] No need for parallel processing
- [ ] Context can be managed in one prompt
- [ ] Sequential processing is acceptable

### Multi-Agent Required When:
- [ ] Multiple domains of expertise needed
- [ ] Parallel processing provides time benefits
- [ ] Complex dependencies between subtasks
- [ ] Different analytical frameworks required
- [ ] Scale requires distributed processing

### Implementation Readiness:
- [ ] Team has distributed systems experience
- [ ] Monitoring and debugging infrastructure exists
- [ ] Clear cost budget and monitoring
- [ ] Fallback to single agent possible
- [ ] Business value justifies complexity

## Next Steps for Agent-OS

1. **Phase 1**: Extend current single agent to handle more complex tasks
2. **Phase 2**: Add basic orchestration for 2-agent scenarios
3. **Phase 3**: Implement full multi-agent framework with all patterns
4. **Phase 4**: Add advanced monitoring, cost optimization, and recovery

Remember: **Start simple, prove value, then scale complexity.** Most problems can be solved with one well-designed agent. Use multi-agent systems only when you genuinely need parallel specialization, not because it sounds impressive.
